There should be three directories here:

1. ddsl_content ==> this is some useful stuff packaged along with DDSL as helpful tools to refer to and get set-up quickly.  You shouldn't edit this folder.

2. system_data ==> this folder is for the storage of data that is specific to the user and not ddsl, such as postresql database and specific R/python packages that don't come preinstalled with the container.

3. my_work ==> this folder is created for everything you create.  Code, notebooks, essentially anything that you want to keep (recommended to back-up this folder somewhere also.)
